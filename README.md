# DSA Prep

## Overview
This repository contains solved LeetCode Data Structures and Algorithms problems, implemented as Jupyter notebooks.  
It serves as a reference for commonly used problem-solving patterns.

---

## Repository Structure
- Each problem is implemented in a separate Jupyter notebook.
- Notebook names match the corresponding LeetCode problem titles.

**Included problems (examples):**
- Two Sum
- Reverse Integer
- Median of Two Sorted Arrays
- Longest Palindromic Substring
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Merge Sorted Array
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
- Palindrome Number
- Plus One
- Sqrt(x)

## Instructions to Run Locally

### Requirements
- Python **3.8+**
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab  
  *(VS Code with the Jupyter extension also works)*

### Setup Instructions
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install JupyterLab
pip install jupyterlab

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab
```

### Using VS Code
1. Open the repository folder in VS Code
2. Install the **Jupyter** extension
3. Open any `.ipynb` file and run the cells

---

## Notebook Format
Each notebook generally includes:
- Problem statement
- Approach / intuition
- Python implementation
- Time and space complexity analysis

---

## Contributing Guidelines
- Add one notebook per problem
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Include explanation and complexity analysis
- Pull requests for improvements or alternate solutions are welcome
